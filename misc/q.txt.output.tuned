"To solve this, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):\n\n1. Multiply -2 and -34: -2 * -34 = 68\n2. Subtract 68 from 50: 50 - 68 = -18\n3. Subtract 77 from -18: -18 - 77 = -95\n\nThe result is -95."
"To calculate the result, we'll multiply the numbers step by step:\n\n-87 * 32 = -2784\n-2784 * 65 = -182920\n\nThe result is -182920."
"To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):\n\n1. Parentheses: None in this case.\n2. Exponents: None in this case.\n3. Multiplication: \n   30 * 98 = 2940\n4. Division: \n   2940 / 2 = 1470\n5. Addition and Subtraction: \n   41 + 29 = 70\n   70 - 1470 = -1390\n\nThe result is: -1390"
"To calculate this, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):\n\n1. Multiply -17 and 82: -17 * 82 = -1406\n2. Add -14 to the result: -1406 + -14 = -1420\n\nThe result is -1420."
"To calculate the result, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):\n\n1. Multiply -13 and 67: -13 * 67 = -871\n2. Multiply the result by -64: -871 * -64 = 558384\n3. Subtract 89 from the result: 558384 - 89 = 558295\n\nThe result is: 558295"
"To solve this, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):\n\n1. Multiply 21 by -12: 21 * -12 = -252\n2. Subtract -252 from 72: 72 - (-252) = 72 + 252 = 324\n\nThe result is 324."
"To find the result, we need to add the two numbers:\n\n-15 + -21 = -36"
"To solve this, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):\n\n1. Multiply -61 by -8: -61 * -8 = 488\n2. Add 95 to the result: 95 + 488 = 583\n\nThe answer is 583."
